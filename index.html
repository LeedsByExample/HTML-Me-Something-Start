            <p>Donut County is an indie game in which you control a hole that swallows up everything in its path, plunging a small town into chaos. You play as a racoon named BK, delivering these (donut) holes to the hungry and unassuming townspeople unfortunate enough to mistake your food service for good service.</p>

If you like reasonably easy puzzles with quirky characters and a lighthearted storyline, and are looking to waste only an hour or two of your time, this game is for you.</p>

            <h2 id="octodad-header">&#9733; Octodad: The Dadliest Catch &#9733;</h2>
            <img src="images/octodad.webp" alt="Octodad image">
            <p>Octodad: The Dadliest Catch is a quirky and comical indie game that follows the life of an octopus disguised as a human father. Players must navigate everyday tasks while controlling Octodad's wobbly, awkward movements, all while keeping his true identity hidden from his family. Octodad offers a unique take on the absurdity of mundane life, and showcases the humor in the struggle to blend in as an octopus in a human world - and I think that at its core, that's a feeling we can all relate to in one way or another.</p>
            <p>Octodad: The Dadliest Catch is perfect for gamers who appreciate lighthearted, offbeat humor and unconventional, challenging gameplay. This game is easily the most difficult on the list, and for those of you looking for an even more challenging experience, I would highly suggest the multiplayer mode. If you've ever wondered what it's like to be an eight-legged cephalopod who's living a lie, then this game is perfect for you.</p>
